### Released template basics

**Audience: traveler users**

When a templated is released after the review process, a new released template will be created and listed in the released template page at `/releasedforms/`. A released form can be in a normal `active` status or an `archived` status. A user cannot create new travelers from an archived released template. The admin can prevent the usage of a released template by <button id="obsolete" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Obsolete the released form" class="btn btn-warning">Obsolete</button> it. 

The released templates are versioned. When releasing a template, the traveler application will suggest the user to archive all the previously released templates that are still active and related to the template to the released. In this way, we can ensure there is only one released template for a specific process that has the latest updates.
